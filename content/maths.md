# Mathematics

Visit [**The Number Line**](https://fishfugu.github.io/the-number-line/index.html) â€” my home for mathematical exploration.

It includes:

- Research from my Master's studies
- Visual explainers (animations & videos)
- Articles on Elliptic Curves, Spectral Graph Theory, and more

I aim to help make the abstract concrete, and the complex understandable, wherever I can.
