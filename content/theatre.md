# Theatre

I'm active in the Sydney theatre scene — directing, producing, and performing.

I regularly appear in **The Players In The Pub** rehearsed readings:

I’m working toward establishing a repertory theatre group — performing both housed and touring productions.

Expect updates on shows, scripts, and ideas-in-motion.
