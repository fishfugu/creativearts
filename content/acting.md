# Acting

I've been an actor since childhood — on stage, on screen, and in the studio.

This section of the site brings together my work across:

- **Theatre** — from classical plays to new works
- **Film & TV** — including childhood roles and adult performances
- **Photo Gallery** — a visual history through roles and productions

Acting has been central to my life: training at drama school, performing nationally, and always chasing the next great script.
