# Work at Motorola

I currently work at **Motorola Solutions**, contributing as a Back-End Engineer in the development of large-scale data systems and intelligent infrastructure.

My role involves:
- Designing and optimising cloud-based services
- Building scalable software for critical real-world applications
- Leveraging tools like TypeScript, ElasticSearch, AWS, and distributed queues

What excites me most is the alignment between this work and my broader interests — systems thinking, elegant architecture, and clear communication. Whether I’m writing software, teaching maths, directing theatre, or composing music, it’s always about pattern, structure, and human connection.

Working at Motorola not only challenges and sharpens my engineering skills, but gives me a sense of purpose — contributing to tools that help people respond faster, act more decisively, and stay safe.

It’s a meaningful part of my creative and technical life, and I’m proud to be part of it.
