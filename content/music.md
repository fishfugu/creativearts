I play with the band **Josh Shipton and the Blue Eyed Ravens**. You can find our recordings, gigs, and updates here:

- [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/release/28958059-Josh-Shipton-And-The-Blue-Eyed-Ravens-Rivers-And-Bones)

We play a mix of blues, rock, soul crushing grunge, and storytelling.

Youâ€™ll find audio, lyrics and maybe some behind-the-scenes soon.

I'm working on a project to record some of my own song, and hope to post here soon.

"Hard Work beats Telent every time Talent doesn't Work Hard" -- seen on the wall of a Dance School, often attributed to high school basketball coach Tim Notke and popularised by NBA player Kevin Durant.
